sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?:
time ./sort1 sorted50000.txt = 0m0.453s
time ./sort3 sorted50000.txt = 0m3.020s
sort1 is bubble sort (OMEGA(n)) as it is faster than sort 3 to realize that all values are already sorted.


sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?:
time ./sort1 random50000.txt = 0m7.301s
time ./sort2 random50000.txt = 0m0.392s
time ./sort3 random50000.txt = 0m3.104s
sort2 is merge sort as it's the fastest sorting random5000.txt.

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?:
sort3 (OMEGA(nÂ²)) is selection sort as it is longer to realize that sorted50000.txt than sort2.
